# Playgrounds [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/jhersh/playgrounds.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/jhersh/playgrounds)

A collection of fun Swifty playgrounds. In fact, the below list of playgrounds was itself generated by `ListPlaygrounds.playground`! After each commit, [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jhersh/playgrounds) executes `ListPlaygrounds.playground` and updates this file, `readme.md`.

## Playground List
### ListPlaygrounds.playground
List all playground projects' comments in the current working folder. Pulls out comments starting from the first line in the file until a non-comment line is encountered.

Run it: `xcrun swift ListPlaygrounds.playground/Contents.swift`

### SwiftSpace.playground
Strip trailing whitespace from all .h, .m, and .swift source files in the current directory and recursive subdirectories.

Run it: `xcrun swift SwiftSpace.playground/Contents.swift`
